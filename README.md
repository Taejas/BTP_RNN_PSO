# Particle Swarm Optimization based RNN for inferring Gene Regulatory Networks

This repository contains the scripts for inferring gene regulatory networks from time series gene expression datasets using a **particle swarm optimization based RNN** approach.

A detailed explanation of my work and results can be found in [`Report.pdf`](Report.pdf).

The scripts that utilize iteratively reweighted least squares with decorrelation for the same task can be found in the following repository:
